# GitHub Repository to File Converter

This Python script allows you to download and process files from a GitHub repository, making it easier to share code with chatbots or other applications that don't automatically download code from GitHub.

## Features

- Download and process files from a GitHub repository
- Support for both public and private repositories
- Filter out directories and files with insufficient content
- Combine all remaining files into a single output file

## Usage

To download and process files from a GitHub repository, run the following command:
`python github2file.py <repository_url>`

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to download. For a private repository, use the following format:
`python github2file.py https://:<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/username/repository`


Replace `<USERNAME>` with your GitHub username and `<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your GitHub personal access token.

### Optional Arguments

- `--branch_or_tag`: Specify the branch or tag of the repository to download (default: "main").

### Example

To download and process files from the Hugging Face Transformers repository, run:
`python github2file.py https://github.com/huggingface/transformers`

This will create a file named `transformers.txt` containing the combined source code from the repository.

To download and process files from a private repository, run:

`python github2file.py https://:<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/username/private-repo`


## Output

The script will create a file named `repository_name.txt` (e.g., `transformers.txt`) containing the combined source code from the specified repository. You can then share this file with chatbots or other applications for further analysis or processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
